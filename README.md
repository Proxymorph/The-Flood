# The-Flood
A test project made for an interview application. Showcasing various systems build around parkour, an anxiety meter and much more.
It was put together in around 86 hours throughout a week with a grand total of 8 hours of sleep and 12+ hours of hard work outside of programming each day.


This repo will stay like this, with no future updates. My next plan is to develop a full game around this concept and mechanics. Expanding all the systems, functionalities and story.
